Photomatic

A collection of Shell Scripts for interacting with a camera using gphoto2

Includes
--------

 * Tethering
 * Image Download
 * RAW Processing
 * Image Wiping (Inside "DANGEROUS" Folder)
 * EXIF Copyright Tagging

----

 * gPhoto2/libgphoto2
 * eog (eye of gnome)
 * f-spot
 * ufraw

Notes
-----

I've only used it with my Nikon D3000. In theory, it should work with all cameras supported by gphoto2, but may require tweaking to correctly 
identify file formats (i.e RAW formats)

Installing
----------

Drop in any folder you like, alter the folder paths, file identifiers and copyright message
